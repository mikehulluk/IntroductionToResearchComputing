Hi Everyone,
We are starting a new weekly meeting; Introduction to Research Computing. The style will be relaxed and a combination of discussion, hands-on examples and presentations.
The course will be split into two parts. Initially we will be talking about practical computing; 
 - A general introduction to Linux & Bash (Filesystem & users, environmental variables, basic commands, process control, regular expressions)
 - An introduction to scripting with Python
 - Version Control Systems (git/mercurial)
 - Creating Reports Posters & Presentations (Word,Lyx,Latex,...)
 - Producing Figures
 - More Bash/Linux (Installing from source, pipes and IO redirection, ssh)
 - Data dependencies and WorkFlows, introduction to databases.
  
After Christmas, we will talk about more software-engineering topics; refactoring code, going from scripts to libraries, testing, debugging, using design patterns, profiling.

The aim is to discuss topics that are relevant to new students new to the department; although other people may be interested in coming to specific meetings, for example, Version Control Systems. ( We will send further e-mails when these topics come up ). We will be giving overviews of tools and what they can do, rather than detailed tutorials.

There will be an introductory meeting on Wednesday at 2:00 in XX. 
All are welcome to attend, if you are interested ( and NOT in the first-year DTC) could you please just drop us an email.

Thanks,



Mike Hull & Kryz
